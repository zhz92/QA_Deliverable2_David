IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing

This is the course practice for unit test using technologies like doubles and stubs. Also my first exposure to real world unit testing, especially using the concept of TDD.

In this project, I was able to learn how unit testing looks like. How to design my code more extensible, reliable and testable. This is a great experience for me, and believe I am going to benefit a lot from it in my future career. 

During this practice, there are a few issues that I met and trying to firgure out. The issues are as follows,

1. The TDD concept is really good but at the beginning of the coding, it is hard to apply because of my old habit-coding first, testing second. And it is hard to imagine what to test before I have some code in hand. However, when I practiced with TDD, I found that it is really useful for the entire program. Because it ensures me that each part of my code, each class, each method that I coded were reliable and testable.  

2. I was trying to use dependency injection in my code to make the program more extensible and testable. However, as a junior programmer, it is a little bit difficult to apply this technology due to the abstraction and hard to understand. But finally, I was able to apply dependency injection in my random number generator.

3. One of the test, called VisitorTest.java, I got failure in the test of its method, getCurrentVisitorInfo. The test result indicates that java.lang.nullpointerexception. 

Finally, I want to thank my instructor Dustin Iser for your hard working. Thank you for looking at my code piece by piece and sending me feedback in the middle of night. There is no execuse for me not to learn hard. Really appreciate you help on this.
